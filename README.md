1. Fork down from [Quasi Bound repository]("https://github.com/Quasi-Devs/Quasi-Bound.git")
2. Do git clone to clone down your forked repo into your local environment.
3. ```npm install ``` in order to install all of the necessary dependencies for the repo.
4. Create a .env file that will contain all necessary information for the repo and install the dotenv package. *(You can find all the necessary info for the .env below in the ENV section.)*
5. Issue ```npm run build``` in order to run webpack and build out the project.
6. Run ```npm start``` which will start up your server.

# Env Variables
The **.env** file will house all of your keys and other sensitive information

Variable | Description
--------------|--------------
DB_USER  |serves as your username for your database.
DB_PASS | password for the database.
DB_HOST | host name for the database.
DB_DB | actual database name.
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID | your unique ID for Discord.
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET | unique password that should not be shared with anyone.
DISCORD_REDIRECT | redirect route for after authentication has been complemented.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET | secret token generated by the google authentication API.
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID | client ID generated by the google authentication API.
CLOUD_NAME | name of the cloudinary API instance.
CLOUD_API_KEY | authentication key for cloudinary API image uploads.

# How to Find .env Variables

1. For all database related environment variables above, you can use any cloud-based SQL database that you desired and create an account. **Note: we used ElephantSQL**
2. For all Discord related environment variables above visit [HERE](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create an account for yourself, then head over to the Applications tab in the left sidebar, create a new application for the app, and all necessary environment variables will be given to you.

# Database <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/"><img src="https://www.postgresql.org/media/img/about/press/elephant.png" width=40 height=40></img><a>
If postgresql has been installed onto the local machine prior, proceed into this section. If not, click on the elephant icon above to be redirected to the installation guide.

Start by first checking to see if postgresql is working locally by running the following command:

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```
Once the server begins startup, shell into the database by incorporating the quasiBound.sql file. This will create the needed database, as well as schemas needed for the app to persist accordingly:

```bash
psql postgres < quasiBound.sql
```
For a cloud-based SQL server to persist publically, we have used elephantSQL. Follow this link <a href="https://www.elephantsql.com/">here<a> to configure a elephant instance.

Before proceeding into this section, it is highly recommended to install google cloud SDK globally onto the local machine.
A resourceful tutorial article on configuring cloud SDK can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@nnilesh7756/how-to-install-and-configure-the-google-cloud-sdk-2fad4a7d3ed7">here</a>.
    
Once the application is configured with the appropriate environmental variables and installations, a
deployment strategy will now be implemented.

This application has utilized google cloud for deployment, to begin setting up a personal google cloud
service, follow the guide mentioned below thoroughly to create a new project instance.


```
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/building-app/deploying-web-service
```

Once a new project is fully configured with an app engine, it's now time to set up what the app engine
will read once the application is deployed; the app.yaml.

Let's first create an app.yaml by issuing ```touch app.yaml``` in the root directory of the repository.

Inside of the app.yaml, insert the following code below:

```yaml
runtime: nodejs
env: flex
```
Once the app.yaml is created, the app can now be deployed by executing the command below: *(be sure to connect to the appropriate gcloud project before this step)*
```bash
gcloud app deploy
```
A prompt will then pop up in the middle of the deployment staging. Be sure to issue **Y** to ensure that the file path is
correct for app deployment.
